      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Data Scientist with the ability to work on Machine learning problems in python. Besides, I have a passion for storytelling by seeing the data. Mostly my work will be AI-related concepts dealing with real-world problems. And, I had completed few different projects in data science using python. Learning new technologies and concepts in AI was my keen interest which usually growing in me daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My latest achievement is cracking the TensorFlow Developer Certification provided by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from these, I have an interest in writing the things that are learned in data science. And I started learning these concepts through online platforms which made my skills strong in this field as a self-learner, it is hard to grab the things. So, I decided to write blogs about data science in easy to understand with resources that help others.&lt;/p&gt;
